# NAMD-MD

 This repository tries to introduce molecular dynamics of the protein-ligand complex to more people, especially those beginners, with all open-sourced resources. 
 
 - VMD (https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/), 
 - NAMD (https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/) and
 - py3Dmol (https://github.com/avirshup/py3dmol), as well as
 - Open babel (https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel) are the main components contained in this protocol.The force file package used is
 - Charmm as per https://www.charmm.org/charmm/resources/charmm-force-fields/ for protein, small molecules are parameterized by web server 
 - LigPargen (http://zarbi.chem.yale.edu/ligpargen/).


# Usage
There are two ways you could use this workflow,

## 1. Run this procedure on Colab directly where all dependencies are installed on the fly each time you use it
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://github.com/quantaosun/NAMD-MD/blob/main/NAMD-MD.ipynb)


## 2. Locally use after installing all dependencies by yourself.
