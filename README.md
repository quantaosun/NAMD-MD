# Usage
There are two ways you could use this workflow,

## 1. Run this procedure on Colab directly where all dependencies are installed on the fly each time you use it
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://github.com/quantaosun/NAMD-MD/blob/main/NAMD-MD.ipynb)


## 2. Locally use after installing all dependencies by yourself.
