# NAMD-MD

 This repository tries to introduce molecular dynamics of the protein-ligand complex to more people, especially those beginners, with all open-sourced resources. VMD (https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/), NAMD (https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/) and py3Dmol (https://github.com/avirshup/py3dmol), as well as open babel (https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel) are the main components contained in this protocol. The force file package used is charmm as per https://www.charmm.org/charmm/resources/charmm-force-fields/ for protein, small molecules are parameterized by web server LigPargen (http://zarbi.chem.yale.edu/ligpargen/).

This is designed only for learning purposes, anyone with commercial purposes might need to check out by themself if they need a commercial license in relation to some certain package, even if these are all "open source".

# Usage
There are two ways you could use this workflow,
## 1. Locally use after installing all dependencies by yourself.

## 2. Run this procedure on Colab directly where all dependencies are installed on the fly each time you use it
